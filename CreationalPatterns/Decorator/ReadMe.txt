What..?
	This pattern lets you attach the new responsibilites dynamically.
	Decorator design pattern adds additional functionalities to the object by wrapping it.

When...?
	We want to add new functionalities to existing objects dynamically

Why..?
	More flexibility than static inheritance.
	The Decorator pattern provides a more flexible way to add responsibilities to objects than
	can be had with static (multiple) inheritance. With decorators, responsibilities can be added
	and removed at run-time simply by attaching and detaching them.
