What..?
	It provides the unifies interface to set of interfaces in the system.
	The Façade Design Pattern defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

Why..?
	Developers often use the facade design pattern when a system is very complex or difficult
	to understand because the system has many interdependent classes or because its source code 
	is unavailable. 
	This pattern hides the complexities of the larger system and provides a simpler interface 
	to the client.

When..?
	We want to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem.
	Subsystems often get more complex as they evolve.
	There are many dependencies between clients and the implementation classes
