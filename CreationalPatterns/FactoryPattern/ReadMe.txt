Factory pattern hides the creation of objects from the client
It hides the creational logic.
Factory method is a creational design pattern which solves the problem of creating product obejcts without specifying their
concrete classes.
The factory method defines a method, whch should be used for creating objects instead of using a direct
constructor call(new operator).
Factory pattern removes the instantiation of actual implementation classes from client code. 
Factory pattern makes our code more robust, less coupled and easy to extend.
