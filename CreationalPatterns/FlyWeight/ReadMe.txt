What..?
	Flyweight is a structural design pattern that lets you fit more objects into the available amount 
	of RAM by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data
	in each object.
	Common properties are called intrinsic
	Different propertes are called Extrinsic.

Why..?
	Flyweight pattern is primarily used to reduce the number of objects created and to
	decrease memory footprint and increase performance.
