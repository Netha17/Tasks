What..?
	Prototype Design Pattern gives us a way to create new objects from the existing instance of the object.
	That means it clone the existing object with its data into a new object. 
	If we do any changes to the cloned object (i.e. new object) then it does not affect the 
	original object.

Why..?
	Prototype design pattern is used when the Object creation is a costly affair and requires a lot of 
	time and resources and you have a similar object already existing.
	Prototype pattern provides a mechanism to copy the original object to a new object and then modify 
	it according to our needs.
